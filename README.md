# DSP_LAB_4---Noise-and-Filtering


    Salt and pepper noise is best removed by the median filter because it effectively replaces outlier pixel values with the median of surrounding pixels, preserving edge details.

    Linear filtering blurs edges more because it averages surrounding pixel values, which smooths sharp transitions at edges and reduces contrast.

    Adaptive filters can preserve detail by dynamically adjusting their filtering strength based on local image characteristics, such as applying less aggressive filtering at edges detected through local statistics.
